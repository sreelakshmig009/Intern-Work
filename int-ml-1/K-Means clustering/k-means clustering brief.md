# K-means clustering

➡K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.


➡ In other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible

➡ K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.

### The k-means clustering algorithm mainly performs two tasks:

              ➡️ Determines the best value for K center points or centroids by an iterative process.
              
              ➡️ Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Those data points which are near to the particular k-center, create a cluster.

The below diagram explains the working of the K-means Clustering Algorithm:

# How does the K-Means Algorithm Work?
The working of the K-Means algorithm is explained in the below steps:

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.



Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).



Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.



Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.



Step-5: Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster.



Step-6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.



Step-7: The model is ready

# Applications
kmeans algorithm is very popular and used in a variety of applications such as market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation and image compression, etc. The goal usually when we undergo a cluster analysis is either:


➡️ Get a meaningful intuition of the structure of the data we’re dealing with.


➡️ Cluster-then-predict where different models will be built for different subgroups if we believe there is a wide variation in the behaviors of different subgroups. An example of that is clustering patients into different subgroups and build a model for each subgroup to predict the probability of the risk of having heart attack.
